Never click sketchy links - this can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, seesion hijacking, browser hijacking, and xss.

Hover over links to see where they REALLY go, people can edit the text of links to make them more readable.

When reading an email check the Domain Name, if it is from @coinbase.rr.xyz.com do not trust it.

When entering a credit card enter it out of order. Keyloggers record in sequence.
