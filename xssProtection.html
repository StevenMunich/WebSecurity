    <!--A **CSP header** (Content Security Policy header) is an HTTP response header that helps protect web applications from attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. It allows you to specify which sources of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) are trusted and can be loaded by the browser.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com
    ```
    This policy only allows scripts from the same origin and from `trusted.cdn.com`.

    **Benefits:**
    - Reduces XSS risks by blocking untrusted scripts.
    - Controls where resources can be loaded from.
    - Helps enforce secure coding practices.

    You set the CSP header in your server configuration or application code.-->
    <!-- Example of a CSP header -->
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'">

  <p>You searched for: <span id="output"></span></p>

  <script>
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const query = params.get("q");
    //vulnerable to XSS if 'query' is not sanitized
    // For demonstration purposes, we are directly inserting the query into the HTML.
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = query; 
   // document.getElementById("output").innerText = query; // This is a safer alternative, but still not ideal for XSS prevention.
    //TO FIX AS A PREVENTION MEASURE:
    // Use textContent to prevent XSS
    //document.getElementById("output").textContent = query;

    Open it in your browser
    Now try this URL in your browser (after opening the file):

    file:///path-to-your/xss-test.html?q=hello

    It’ll say: > You searched for: hello

    But now try:

    file:///path-to-your/xss-test.html?q=<script>alert('XSS')
    
    It’ll execute the script and show an alert box with "XSS".

    // Note: This is a demonstration of a vulnerability. In production code, always sanitize user input
    // and use secure methods to handle dynamic content.

    //Avoid eval and innerHTML(use textContent instead or Innertext for text nodes).
    
    //Do not use eval() or assign untrusted content to innerHTML or similar APIs.


    //Never ever ever ever ever trust user input in HTML, always sanitize it.
